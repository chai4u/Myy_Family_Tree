# Family_tree Repositoryüë™

### Why a family tree, you ask?ü§îüßê

Well, I wanted to branch out (pun intended) from the usual machine learning model building and create something that's a little more... personal. Plus, I figured it's a great way to get to the root of my family's history (okay, I'll stop with the tree puns now).

### About this repository

This repository contains a web-based family tree representation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this project with the help of already existing code snippet "https://shrihari-lib.netlify.app/lineage.min.js", to visualize my family connections and make it easy to navigate through generations. The frontend allows users to explore the tree and learn about each family member.

### Features

- Interactive family tree visualization
- Clickable nodes to view individual profiles
- Responsive design for easy viewing on various devices
- Easy to update and add new family members

### Technologies used

- HTML for structuring the tree
- CSS for styling and layout

**Note** : This website is not fully responsive. For the best experience,I recommend viewing it on a desktop device.
